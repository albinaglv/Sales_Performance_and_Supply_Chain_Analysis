# North America Supply Chain and Sales Analysis Report

## Project Overview
In any business, the question 'How are we performing?' is essential to driving informed decision-making. To address this need, I developed a Power BI report that provides comprehensive, data-driven insights while prioritising user flexibility
and visual clarity.

Using a rich Supply Chain dataset with transactional data spanning various regions, customer segments, and product shipments, the report delivers an in-depth analysis of sales, order processing, fulfillment, and shipping performance. 
This enables stakeholders to effectively track and optimise supply chain operations. The reportâ€™s drill-through capabilities empower users to explore data interactively and focus on what matters most to them. 
Additionally, it highlights the most profitable orders and product categories, facilitating better resource allocation and pricing strategies. 
By analysing sales at the customer level, it pinpoints top revenue-generating customers and identifies late deliveries, ensuring that key insights are clear and actionable without overwhelming the user.
